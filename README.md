# Iris Flower Classification with Machine Learning

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a machine learning model for the classification of Iris flowers into three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. The model is trained using measurements specific to each species, allowing it to learn and predict the species based on input features.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the model is the famous Iris dataset. While Scikit-learn provides a built-in version of this dataset, I chose to utilize the Kaggle version to showcase flexibility. The dataset can be downloaded from the following link: [Iris Flower Dataset on Kaggle](insert_link_here).

## Requirements
To run the code in this repository, you need the following dependencies:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for running the provided notebook)
- Required Python libraries: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn

You can install the required libraries using the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/iris-flower-classification.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd iris-flower-classification
   ```

3. Download the Iris dataset from Kaggle and place it in the "data" directory.

4. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Iris_Flower_Classification.ipynb
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   python iris_classification.py
   ```

## Model Training
The machine learning model is trained using the scikit-learn library. The dataset is split into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance. The model is trained to classify Iris flowers based on their measurements.

## Results
The model's accuracy and performance metrics are displayed in the Jupyter Notebook or printed in the console when running the Python script.

## Conclusion
This project serves as a simple example of machine learning classification using the Iris dataset. The flexibility of using the Kaggle dataset demonstrates that the same results can be achieved with different sources of the same data.
