# Sales Prediction Using Machine Learning with Python

## Overview
This repository presents a practical approach to sales prediction using machine learning techniques in Python. The goal is to forecast future sales based on various factors such as advertising expenses, target audience segmentation, and advertising platforms. The project aims to assist businesses in making informed decisions to optimize their advertising costs and enhance sales outcomes.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this sales prediction task can be downloaded from the following link: [Sales Prediction Dataset](insert_link_here). The dataset contains relevant features such as advertising expenses, target audience details, and platform information.

## Requirements
To run the code in this repository, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for running the provided notebook)
- Required Python libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

You can install the required libraries using the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sales-prediction.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd sales-prediction
   ```

3. Download the Sales Prediction dataset from the provided link and place it in the "data" directory.

4. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Sales_Prediction.ipynb
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   python sales_prediction.py
   ```

## Model Training
The machine learning model is trained using the scikit-learn library. The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values and encode categorical features. The model is then trained to predict sales based on the input features.

## Results
The notebook or script provides insights into the model's performance, including metrics such as mean squared error, mean absolute error, and R-squared score. Visualizations may also be included to help interpret the predictions.

## Conclusion
This project serves as a starting point for businesses seeking to implement sales prediction models using machine learning. It provides a foundation that can be extended and customized based on specific business needs and additional relevant features.

Feel free to explore, modify, and use this project as a reference for your own sales prediction tasks. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvement, please open an issue or submit a pull request.

Happy predicting and optimizing your sales strategy! ðŸš€ðŸ’¼
